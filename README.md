# Flides
Flides allows to create sets of slides in HTML5, using javascript

The core visualisation features (zoom in particular) is based on [impress.js](https://github.com/impress/impress.js). I added some features:

* slide steps, allowing to display slides by small bits (using 'right'), with a quick mode ('down')
* navigational shortcuts: 'enter' for going ot the overview and 'backspace' for going to the beginning,
* always visible slides,
* animation using SVG,
* partial overviews, showing what was already seen but not what is coming after,
* clickable / not clickable slides... 

You can check out this basic [demo](https://github.com/nathanael-fijalkow/Flides/Demo) I made.
Please find [here](https://github.com/nathanael-fijalkow/Flides/2019-01-23-CAALM_Universal_Graphs) and [here](https://github.com/nathanael-fijalkow/Flides/2019-06-05-ForMaL-Cachan) two complete sets of slides.

If you have troubles visualising them:
* If you see nothing: you are using a too old browser which did not yet implement the latest HTML5 features used there, or you did not enable javascript. I can do nothing for you.
* If it's slow and laggy: you may want to try Google Chrome, as it's definitely the best browser for this.
* If some parts of the slides do not fit the windows: it's because you use a zoom in your browser, play with it (usually, setting it to between 67% and 100% works just fine).

All comments and questions are most welcome! I'd be very glad to help you making HTML5 slides.
